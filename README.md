# 500-hidden-layer-model-for-MNIST

Python based Neural Network for Charactor recognition using MNIST data set.

In this Neural network, there are 500 hidden layers.
Tanh optimization function has been used for the hidden layers.
And for the output layer, Softmax function is used.

This program runs on CPU defaulty.
If you want to use GPU instead, go to the link below and follow the intructions on how to use GPU in Theano.
